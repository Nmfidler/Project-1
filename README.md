# Summary:

More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the olympics since 1896. Our dataset, “Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896 - 2014” dives into the history of the olympics, showing data for every olympic medal winner in the last 100+ years.

# Alec Analysis:
For 80 years from 1910 - 1990 the number of olympic athletes winining medals remained constant, however after the year 1990, the data shows a statistically significant increase in the number of athletes winning medals. This remains constant for both summer and winter olympcs. Our analysis of the data shows that after the year 1990, 8 new sports, and 119 new unqiue events were added to the olympics (summer and winter), which explains the significant increase in number of athletes winning medals per olympic games. 

Throughout the 100+ year span of the dataset, the most popular sport by number of countries winning medals is Athletics. There have been 56 different events in Athletics throughout the history of the datsset, with 79 different countries having won at least 1 medal in the sport. The United States has won the most medals in this sport with a total of 994. As explained in a later analysis, this finding is supported by the fact the United States has won almost 4x the amount of medals in the summer olympics than any other country. 

# Bianca's Analysis:

In reviewing the clean data, it was discovered that the following 10 countries were the countries with the highest GDP (in descending order): Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Qatar, Ireland, Australia, USA, Singapore, Denmark, and Sweden.  Therefore, out of the top 10 Countries with the highest GDP, there are 6 European Countries. However, although Luxembourg has the Highest GDP, the country does not have the most olympic athletes with awards. Additionaly, although USA has only the 7th Highest GDP rating, the country has the most medal wins.

In focusing on men/women data components, it was observed that men have consistently earned more medals than women in olympic sports. This is likely due to most sports were originally available for men, especially at the early stages of the olympics. That being said, women have increased their medal count over the years, since 1896. This likely because more sports have become available for women to participate in over the years. Of course, it is important to note that in 1994 started a change in Olympic Sports. Winter/Summer sports were no longer held in the same year, therefore reducing the amount of medals per year awarded to men/women. This would explain why the trend is adjusted and reset in 1896. 

In reviewing which countries had the most olympic women medalists, it was discovered that the Top 10 countries (in descending order) are: USA, Soviet Union, China, Germany, Australia, Russia, Canada, East Germany, Netherlands, Romania. As a notes, some of these countries are no longer relevant in modern times, this is a gap in the data we identified by not focusing in on a specific time period of the Olympics. Additionally, it was determined, Australia and USA the only countries also with Top 10 GDP. That was able to direct us to understanding that high GDP does not correlate to countries having the best women medalists. Additionally, high GDP does not have direct causation to accessibility for women sports.
