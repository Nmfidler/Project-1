Summary:

More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the olympics since 1896. Our dataset, “Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896 - 2014” dives into the history of the olympics, showing data for every olympic medal winner in the last 100+ years.

Questions in Focus:


Bianca's Analysis:

In reviewing the clean data, it was discovered that the following 10 countries were the countries with the highest GDP (in descending order): Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Qatar, Ireland, Australia, USA, Singapore, Denmark, and Sweden.  Therefore, out of the top 10 Countries with the highest GDP, there are 6 European Countries. However, although Luxembourg has the Highest GDP, the country does not have the most olympic athletes with awards. Additionaly, although USA has only the 7th Highest GDP rating, the country has the most medal wins.

In focusing on men/women data components, it was observed that men have consistently earned more medals than women in olympic sports. This is likely due to most sports were originally available for men, especially at the early stages of the olympics. That being said, women have increased their medal count over the years, since 1896. This likely because more sports have become available for women to participate in over the years. Of course, it is important to note that in 1994 started a change in Olympic Sports. Winter/Summer sports were no longer held in the same year, therefore reducing the amount of medals per year awarded to men/women. This would explain why the trend is adjusted and reset in 1896.
