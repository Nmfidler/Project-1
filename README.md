# Summary:

More than 35,000 medals have been awarded at the olympics since 1896. Our dataset, “Olympic Sports and Medals, 1896 - 2014” dives into the history of the olympics, showing data for every olympic medal winner in the last 100+ years.

# Questions in Focus:

# Alec Analysis:
For 80 years from 1910 - 1990 the number of olympic athletes winining medals remained constant, however after the year 1990, the data shows a statistically significant increase in the number of athletes winning medals. This remains constant for both summer and winter olympcs. Our analysis of the data shows that after the year 1990, 8 new sports, and 119 new unqiue events were added to the olympics (summer and winter), which explains the significant increase in number of athletes winning medals per olympic games. 

Throughout the 100+ year span of the dataset, the most popular sport by number of countries winning medals is Athletics. There have been 56 different events in Athletics throughout the history of the datsset, with 79 different countries having won at least 1 medal in the sport. The United States has won the most medals in this sport with a total of 994. As explained in a later analysis, this finding is supported by the fact the United States has won almost 4x the amount of medals in the summer olympics than any other country. 

# Bianca's Analysis:

In reviewing the clean data, it was discovered that the following 10 countries were the countries with the highest GDP (in descending order): Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Qatar, Ireland, Australia, USA, Singapore, Denmark, and Sweden.  Therefore, out of the top 10 Countries with the highest GDP, there are 6 European Countries. However, although Luxembourg has the Highest GDP, the country does not have the most olympic athletes with awards. Additionaly, although USA has only the 7th Highest GDP rating, the country has the most medal wins.

In focusing on men/women data components, it was observed that men have consistently earned more medals than women in olympic sports. This is likely due to most sports were originally available for men, especially at the early stages of the olympics. That being said, women have increased their medal count over the years, since 1896. This likely because more sports have become available for women to participate in over the years. Of course, it is important to note that in 1994 started a change in Olympic Sports. Winter/Summer sports were no longer held in the same year, therefore reducing the amount of medals per year awarded to men/women. This would explain why the trend is adjusted and reset in 1896. 

In reviewing which countries had the most olympic women medalists, it was discovered that the Top 10 countries (in descending order) are: USA, Soviet Union, China, Germany, Australia, Russia, Canada, East Germany, Netherlands, Romania. As a notes, some of these countries are no longer relevant in modern times, this is a gap in the data we identified by not focusing in on a specific time period of the Olympics. Additionally, it was determined, Australia and USA the only countries also with Top 10 GDP. That was able to direct us to understanding that high GDP does not correlate to countries having the best women medalists. Additionally, high GDP does not have direct causation to accessibility for women sports.

# Natasha Analysis:
When looking at the Top 10 Countries with the most Gold Medals for summer the data reveals a notable trend indicating the United States' consistent success in the Summer Olympics. This is shown by the accumulation of the highest number of Gold Medals over time. This suggests a sustained level of excellence and success in the competitions.The data also indicates that the US has amassed nearly four times the number of Gold Medals compared to other countries. This substantial lead highlights the gap in performance, underscoring the United States' dominance and possibly indicating a high level of competitiveness and success in Olympic  summer events.

Compareably when focusing on the data for the Top 10 Countries with the mosy Gold Medals for winter the data underscores a significant correlation between economic strength and sporting success, as both the United States and Sweden share positions on the top 10 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) list and the Summer Olympics' Gold Medal rankings. This suggests a possible correlation between economic resources and athletic achievements, showcasing the national prominence. Also, a standout observation is Canada's exceptional performance in the Summer Olympics, emerging as the country with the most Gold Medals. This feat becomes even more remarkable as Canada nearly doubles the number of Gold Medals achieved by the United States.

The data also reveals an intriguing overlap between five countries that consistently feature on both the Summer and Winter Olympics' top Gold Medal lists. This trend suggests a sustained excellence in different sporting disciplines, transcending the seasonal divide and showcasing the consistent competitive strength of these nations in both Summer and Winter Olympic events. These five larger countries are also on the list of top 10 GDPs in the country, something to note about the correlation between GDP and success.

Looking at the data of the top 10 athletes with gold medals from the winter olympics the data highlights a significant trend in the Winter Olympics, where four out of the top 10 athletes with the most Gold Medals are from Norway. This substantial representation underscores Norway's proficiency in winter sports, establishing the country as a major force in terms of individual athletic achievements in this specific category. Examining the broader distribution, the remaining six positions in the top 10 athletes with Gold Medals are occupied by representatives from the United States (2), Finland (1), Germany (1), Sweden (1), and China (1). Notably, the countries with athletes in the top 10 Gold Medalists list also find representation on the broader Top 10 Countries with Gold Medals list. The interconnectedness of individual and national success in the Olympics is evident from the shared presence of countries on both lists.

Lastly, when focusing on the data of the top 10 athletes with gold medals from the summer the data reveals a significant dominance of the United States in Summer Olympics, with six out of the top 10 athletes holding the most Gold Medals.This overwhelming representation highlights the USA's prowess in various summer sporting disciplines, highlighting the country's ability to produce consistently successful athletes on the global stage. The remaining four positions in the top 10 athletes with Gold Medals for Summer Olympics are occupied by athletes from Finland, Japan, Hungary, and Italy. An interesting observation emerges when analyzing the medal counts of athletes after Michael Phelps. Following Phelps, the data indicates a notable similarity in the number of medals held by the remaining athletes in the top 10. The presence of the United States, Hungary, and Italy in both the Top 10 Athletes with Gold Medals and the Top 10 Countries with Gold Medals lists underscores the correlation between individual athlete success and overall national performance.
